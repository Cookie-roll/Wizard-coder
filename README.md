# Examples

## Local prompt examples

```
http://localhost:7860/?prompt=a%20pong%20game%20clone%20in%20HTML,%20made%20using%20the%20canvas
```
```
http://localhost:7860/?prompt=a simple html canvas game where we need to feed tadpoles controlled by an AI. The tadpoles move randomly, but when the user click inside the canvas to add some kind of food, the tadpoles will compete to eat it. Tadpole who didn't eat will die, and those who ate will reproduce.
```
